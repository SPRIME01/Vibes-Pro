# Developer-Centric Docs Guardrails

-   Treat developers as end-users and the dev environment as a product platform.
-   When adding or updating developer docs:
    -   Prefer task-based “how-to” and “playbook” structures.
    -   Provide copy-pastable commands and minimal viable scaffolds.
    -   Reference `DEV-PRD-xxx / DEV-ADR-xxx / DEV-SDS-xxx / DEV-TS-xxx` where relevant.
-   If a developer guideline conflicts with ADR/SDS/TS, capture a Spec Gaps note and link to the PR proposing a resolution.
