# Generate AI Guidance Docs from Product & Developer Specs

## Read First

-   Product specs (if present):
    -   `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/ADR.md`, `docs/SDS.md`,
    -   `docs/technical_specifications.md` (or `docs/technical_specifictions.md` if present)
-   Developer specs:
    -   `docs/dev_prd.md`, `docs/dev_adr.md`, `docs/dev_sds.md`, `docs/dev_technical-specifications.md`

## Task

Create/update four spec-aligned docs in `docs/`:

1. `ai_custom_instructions.md`

    - Project-specific rules (style, architecture, naming, data models).
    - Security/compliance from TS/SDS/DEV-TS.
    - Include both product (PRD/ADR/SDS/TS) and developer (DEV-PRD/DEV-ADR/DEV-SDS/DEV-TS) citations for each bullet.

2. `ai_prompt_library.md`

    - Reusable prompts for scaffolding, core features, data/API, integration & testing.
    - Each prompt lists relevant spec IDs (product + dev).

3. `ai_implementation_roadmap.md`

    - Phased plan + dependencies (SDS/TS), MVP path (PRD).
    - Include DX enablement phases derived from DEV specs.
    - Validation checkpoints tie to PRD acceptance and DEV readiness criteria.

4. `ai_coding_standards.md`
    - Organization patterns (SDS/TS), API standards, error handling.
    - Testing and documentation standards with traceability.
    - Include DX standards (branching, commit semantics, test gates, lint, type-check).

## Output Rules

-   Write files directly to `docs/`.
-   Use clear headers, numbered lists, and small code examples.
-   Maintain the Traceability Matrix in `ai_implementation_roadmap.md`.
-   If specs are ambiguous or conflict, add a Spec Gaps section with options.

## Acceptance Criteria

-   Every section cites at least one product and/or dev spec ID.
-   Roadmap marks MVP and DX enablement clearly.
-   Prompt library is copy/paste ready.
