# Logfire Observability Blueprint

> Traceability: DEV-PRD-018 · DEV-SDS-018 · DEV-PRD-021

This guide captures the Logfire defaults shipped with the VibesPro template.
Cycle 2A will extend these notes with full instrumentation walkthroughs once
`bootstrap_logfire` evolves beyond the stub phased in during Cycle 1.

## Environment Variables

{{ render_logfire_env_table(project_slug) }}

## Local Usage

- Keep `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` empty while developing locally. Set
  `LOGFIRE_SEND_TO_LOGFIRE={{ default_logfire_send_to_logfire() }}` to control remote export when you add a token.
- Override `LOGFIRE_ENVIRONMENT` per environment (`development`, `staging`,
  `production`) to keep dashboards segmented.
- Point `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` at your observability pipeline. The
  defaults target Vector’s local OTLP listener (`http://localhost:4318`).

## Deployment Checklist

1. Store `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` in your secrets manager (SOPS, GitHub Actions, etc.).
2. Promote `LOGFIRE_SEND_TO_LOGFIRE` to `true` (or leave
   `if-token-present` to gate on token availability).
3. Update `LOGFIRE_SERVICE_NAME` if the deployment uses multiple FastAPI apps;
   keep the value aligned with `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` to preserve dashboards.
4. Add release automation that sets `LOGFIRE_SERVICE_VERSION` to your semantic
   version so traces line up with shipped artifacts.
