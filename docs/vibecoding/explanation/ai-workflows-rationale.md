# Explanation: Why this AI Workflow 🧠

We prioritize architecture-first, spec-driven development while leveraging Copilot. Chat modes encode TDD/Debug discipline and keep work within CALM + tech stack boundaries.

-   Merge-over-add prompts; avoid duplication.
-   Namespaced `ai-*` modes and tasks to prevent collisions.
-   Context bundle makes Copilot answers architecture-aware.
