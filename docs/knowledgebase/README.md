# VibePDK Knowledge Base

Welcome to the VibePDK Knowledge Base. This is your single source of truth for understanding the architecture, workflows, and tools of the VibePDK platform.

This knowledge base is organized into four main sections, based on the Diátaxis framework, to help you find the information you need quickly and efficiently.

- **[Explanation](#explanation):** High-level concepts, architectural principles, and design rationale.
- **[How-To Guides](#how-to-guides):** Practical, task-oriented instructions to solve specific problems.
- **[Tutorials](#tutorials):** Step-by-step guides to help you get started with common tasks.
- **[Reference](#reference):** Detailed information on APIs, commands, and configurations.
